# Project Ketertarikan Mahasiswa Universitas dalam Berolahraga Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the interest of students at University in sports activities using machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The goal is to identify patterns and factors influencing student participation in sports and to develop predictive models that can help in enhancing student engagement in physical activities.

## Key Features
1. Data Collection:
* Gathering survey data from students at University XXX regarding their interest and participation in sports activities.
* Including features such as age, gender, field of study, academic year, frequency of sports activities, and types of sports.

2. Data Preprocessing:
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.
* Splitting data into training and testing sets.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
* Visualizing data using histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to identify trends and patterns.

4. Model Development:
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
  * Implementing KNN for classification based on the proximity of data points.
* Support Vector Machine (SVM):
  * Using SVM to classify student interest by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes.
* Random Forest:
  * Developing a Random Forest classifier to leverage multiple decision trees for improved prediction accuracy.

5. Model Evaluation:
* Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Performing cross-validation to ensure model robustness and reliability.

6. Visualization:
* Creating visualizations to present model performance and insights.
* Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization.

7. Objectives
* Predict Student Interest: Develop predictive models to determine the interest of students in sports activities.
* Identify Influencing Factors: Understand the key factors that influence student participation in sports.
* Enhance Engagement: Provide insights and recommendations to increase student engagement in physical activities.

8. Insights
* Key Influencers: Identified factors such as academic year, field of study, and frequency of sports activities as significant predictors of student interest in sports.
* Model Performance: Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy and reliability in predicting student interest, followed by SVM and KNN.
* Engagement Strategies: Provided actionable recommendations to university administrators for promoting sports activities, such as targeted sports programs and facilities improvement.
